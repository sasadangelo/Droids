# Droids

Droids is a Tetris clone for Android created only for Educational purpose. The goal of this software is to teach to programmers how to make 
videogame in Androids. This software is also useful for people with no programming skills that want to learn to write apps for Android using 
a very exciting first project.

Since Education is the only goal of this project there is not an already apk available for the game neither on this website nor on the Android market. If you want to try the game you have to build it by yourself (very soon I will add the info on how to do that).
